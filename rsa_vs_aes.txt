RSA is an asymmetric encryption method that uses a public and private key. It is slower and usually is used for encrypting small amounts of data, like keys.
AES is a symmetric encryption method that uses one secret key for both encryption and decryption. It is much faster and better for encrypting large files.
In real-world systems, RSA is often used to securely share an AES key, and AES is then used to encrypt the actual message.
